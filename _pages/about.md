I am a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Biostatistics, working with Professor [Ali Shojaie](https://faculty.washington.edu/ashojaie/index.html). I am also a UW Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow affiliated with the eScience Institute. Previously, I obtained a PhD from Tel Aviv University under the supervision of Professor [Malka Gorfine](https://www.tau.ac.il/~gorfinem/). I am broadly interested in the analysis of complex biomedical datasets, particularly statistical challenges arising in electronic health records—including survival analysis and privacy constraints—as well as the study of biological networks.
